class ActuationModel:
    """ Abstract base class for MIMo's actuation model.

    This class defines the functions that all implementing classes must provide.

    Control inputs have two conceptual levels: The desired control input (i.e. maximum output in one direction),
    and the actual control input to the simulation motors. In the simulation the motor response is linear and
    instantaneous, but this may not be desired. Actuation models can model time-dependent or non-linear torque
    generation by taking the desired control input and altering it before passing it to the simulation.
    Actuation models can define an arbitrary control method, but must compute control inputs for the actual simulation
    motors as defined in the XMLs.

    The key functions are:

    - :meth:`.get_action_space` determines the actuation space attribute for the gym environment. This should have the
      shape of the input to the abstract model motors.
    - :meth:`.action` computes the actual control inputs to the simulation motors from a control input to the abstract
      motors. :meth:`.substep_update` is called on every physics step and allows torques to be updated between
      environment steps.
    - :meth:`.observations` should return any actuation-related quantities that could reasonably be used as
      observations for the gym environment. Note that these will only actually be included if the proprioception
      module is appropriately configured.
    - :meth:`.cost` should return the cost of the current activations. This can represent the metabolic cost or an
      action penalty. This function is not used by default, but environments may use it as they wish, for example during
      reward calculation.
    - :meth:`.reset` should reset whatever internal quantities the model uses to the value at the start of the
      simulation.
